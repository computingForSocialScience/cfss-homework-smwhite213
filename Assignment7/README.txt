

TO THE TAs:
I had some issues that I was not able to resolve. I appear to be able to create playlists
and tables of playlists, but I cannot get the results to display on a website.
Also, I am having an issue running code in Cygwin that appears to concern how
Python, Cygwin, and MySQL communicate with each other.

Stage 1: I was able to pull up the website before creating playlists just fine. There
was a navigation page and a couple of links but nothing else. 

Stage 2: Based on print code for part 1, it appears the tables are okay but now
nothing is displaying online. I keep getting a "This webpage is not available"
error. Attempts to fix this during TA session were not helpful.

The rest of the code is what I would have attempted if things had worked.
